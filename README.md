# CityBlocks
Generating city blocks in a really dumb way

This generator uses Python 2.7 and PyGame to generate a random map in the style of city streets.  
It's really basic, and has no intelligence. I mostly just did it because I wanted to see how quickly I could get something to generate that looks like a city map.  
All of the angles are right for now, but it can easily be made to do diagonals. It just needs some weighting to make sure that there aren't a ton of criss-crossing diagonal roads, because that doesn't really happen in cities.
